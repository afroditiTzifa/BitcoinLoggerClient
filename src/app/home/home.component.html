    Welcome to my new web platform that fetches Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) from multiple sources and presents them to the user.
    <br/>
    Each bitcoin entry has a price and a timestamp. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Two BTC/USD price sources has been used.
    <br/>1. Bitstamp : https://www.bitstamp.net/api/ticker/ 
    <br/>2. GDAX : https://api.gdax.com/products/BTC-USD/ticker/
